# Flight App (named: Sky)
This is an imitation flight booking tool, a group project for a mobile applications class.   

It's not functional in this form. Currently is set up to access a server holding flight data which is shut down, and I've extracted only my own work from the entire project, hence it not working. Maybe in the future I'll make it something fully fledged?

## Structure
App.js is the root of the app, controling the tab navigation.  
book_nav.js and manage_nav.js manage the page navigation of their respective tabs.
Book.js and searchBooking.js are the landing page of each tab.
Most of the other .js files (in camelCase) are pages of the app.
