# Flight App (named: Sky)
This is an imitation flight booking tool, a group project for a mobile applications class. 

It's not functional in this form. Currently is set up to access a server holding flight data which is shut down, and I've extracted only my own work from the entire project, hence it not working. Maybe in the future I'll make it something fully fledged?

## Structure
App.js is the root of the app.
book_nav and manage_nav manage the two tabs of the app.
Most of the other .js files (in camelCase) are pages of the app.
