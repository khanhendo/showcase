# Undergraduate Research - Multi-Robot Exploration.
A showcase of some my work I did in the summer of 2022 with Khang Vo Huyng and Ethan Kilmer under the mentorship of Prof. Elizabeth A Jensen. Credit to my teammates for helping conduct the experients, and being great to work with!

# Description of files
mapMaker.py - visualizing the experients we conducted.
labelProcessing.py - preprocessing network and LiDAR data the robot collected for machine learning.
RNS #1 - Usually an experiment's worth of data would be in a directory like this. I've excluded the data, but included a py script to generate the visualization for that experiment.
